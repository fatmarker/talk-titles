# Talk Titles
This is a collection of on-screen talk titles for use during congregation public meetings. They are made in the style of the new song videos. The images are exported from Adobe InDesign CC. The content is based on the S-99 form.

Keep reading if you want to know how I compile these. I'm sure there is a better way to do this, so I'm open to suggestions.

## Copying Talk Titles into InDesign
The fastest way I have found is by the following steps:

1) select and copy the text of the S-99
2) paste into a plain text document and save
3) in Excel or Calc, use the import feature
4) choose to separate data by '.' (period)
5) import; the talk numbers and titles should be in 2 separate columns
6) copy the talk title column
7) paste into InDesign

You will still have to make minor adjustments to the individual pages (slides). But at least now you don't have to individually copy 200 lines of text (or delete 200 numbers).

## Exporting from InDesign
Export as PNG. The settings are:

### Export
All pages

### Image
• Quality: Maximum  
• Resolution (ppi): 72  
• Color Space: RGB

### Options
Anti-alias

## Adjustments
There are 3 possible page templates to accomodate different lengths of talk titles:  
• 1L = 1-line  
• 2L = 2-line  
• 3L = 3-line

## Versioning
The version number is based on the date of the S-99, its language code, and builds.  
  
[S-99 year].[S-99 month].[build]-[S-99 language]  

For example: 16.1.0-E
