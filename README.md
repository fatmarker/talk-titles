# Talk Titles
On-screen talk titles for use during congregation meetings. They are made in the style of the song videos. The images are laid out in Adobe InDesign CC. The content is based on the S-99 form.

# Copying Talk Titles into InDesign
The fastest way I have found is by the following steps:

1) select and copy the text of the S-99
2) paste into a plain text document and save
3) using Excel or Calc, use the import feature
4) separate data by '.' (period)
5) import; this will separate the talk numbers and titles into 2 columns
6) copy the talk title column
7) paste into the InDesign file in this repository

You will still have to make minor adjustments to the individual pages (slides). But at least now you don't have to individually copy 200 lines of text (or delete 200 numbers).

# Adjustments
There are 3 possible page templates depending on the length of the talk title:
1-line
2-line
3-line

# Versioning
The version number is based on the date of the S-99, its language code, plus builds.

[S-99 year].[S-99 month].[build]-[S-99 language]
16.1.0-E
