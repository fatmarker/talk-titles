# Talk Titles
This is a collection of on-screen talk titles for use during congregation public meetings. They are made in the style of the new song videos. The images are exported from Adobe InDesign CC. The content is based on the S-99 form.

Keep reading if you want to know how I compile these. I'm sure there is a better way to do this, so I'm open to suggestions.

## Copying Talk Titles into InDesign
The fastest way I have found is by the following steps:

1) select and copy the text of the S-99
2) paste into a text editor
3) clean up the file: make sure each title is on a separate line; remove running footers 
4) save as .csv (see `assets/examples/talk-title-import.csv`)
5) in Excel or Calc, use the import feature
6) choose to separate data by '.' (period)
7) import; the talk numbers and titles should be in 2 separate columns
8) copy the talk title column
9) paste into InDesign

You will still have to make minor adjustments to the individual pages (slides). But at least now you don't have to individually copy 200 lines of text (or delete 200 numbers).

## Adjustments
Some titles are short, some are long. Go through each page to make sure it looks okay.  

To accomodate different lengths of talk titles, there are 3 page templates to choose from:  
• 1L = 1-line  
• 2L = 2-line  
• 3L = 3-line
  
Start with the 3-line template to give you room for experimentation. Apply good text layout principles. Add line breaks where necessary. Ask someone with experience in text layout and a strong grasp of the language to assist you.  
  
Poorly laid-out talk text can be distracting to the distinguishing eye.

## Exporting from InDesign
Export as PNG. The settings are:

### Export
All pages

### Image
• Quality: Maximum  
• Resolution (ppi): 72  
• Color Space: RGB

### Options

## Translation
If you want these in another language, all the files are here for you to do that; I will only maintain the English version.

## Versioning
The version number is based on the date of the S-99, its language code, and builds.  
  
[S-99 year].[S-99 month].[build]-[S-99 language]  

For example: 16.1.0-E
